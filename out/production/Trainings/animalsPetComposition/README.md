# Animals

Implement an object oriented solution for creating the following animals:
Cat
Dog
Duck
Lion
Sparrow
Hawk
Wolf
Whale



Some of them are birds and some of them are mammals.
I want to know how many legs an animal has.



Animals can move but some of them walk, some fly, some swim. Some can do a combination of those, like a duck can walk, swim and fly. A dog can walk and swim.
I want to know how the animals move. For example for a dog: it should print "I walk on 4 legs" and "I can swim". For a whale it should print "I can swim".



Animals in this example can make sounds. I want to see how an animal sounds like.



All animals eat. I want to see what they like to eat. For instance for a cat it can print "I like to eat tuna fish".



Some of those animals can be pets by nature. Pets have names, the other animals don't. I also want to know if a pet is trained.
Pets can play with their owners. I also want to see how a pet plays. For example: it can print out "Fluffy likes to play with a toy mouse", Fluffy being the animal's name.




Please create a class hierarchy and add instance variables, methods where necessary.
Write a class that instantiates animals and demonstrates how they move, play and what they eat, what sounds they make.
Introduce some filtering possibilities like list all animals that can walk and print out how they walk. etc. etc.
