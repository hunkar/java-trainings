# Head Hunting Company

You have a headhunting company that matches available jobs to your job seeking customers.
There are two types of customers:
- Companies
- Job seekers

Companies can add job postings to search for candidates on various fields like software development, technical analysis etc. etc. (enlarge the list as you see fit)
Job seekers look for jobs on a specific subject which suits their skills.

The job of the headhunting company is to notify job seekers when a job in their field is made available by a company.
Also to notify the related company when a job seeker agrees to interview for a job.
Write a JAVA program to achieve the above goal.
